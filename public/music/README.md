# Background Music

To enable background music on your website, add an MP3 file named `background-music.mp3` to this directory.

## Important Notes:

1. The file must be named `background-music.mp3`
2. Keep the file size small (ideally under 1MB) for better performance
3. Music will only play on non-home pages and will stop when returning to the home page
4. Due to browser autoplay policies, the music may only start after user interaction with the page

## Music Attribution

If you're using music from other creators, remember to include proper attribution in your website's footer or about page.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with the background music:

- Make sure the file is in MP3 format
- Check that the file is named exactly `background-music.mp3`
- Try using a different MP3 file, as some encodings might not be compatible with all browsers
